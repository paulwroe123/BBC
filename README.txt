	- README.txt

Dependencies

	- Requires JQuery (jquery-2.1.1.js included)
	- JSON data formatted appropriately (see data.json)	

Rooom for Improvement

	- Refactor/rewrite solution and use TDD
	approach e.g. Jasmine.

	- Use JSDOC3 to comment code and produce
	professional documentation.

	- Adopt a more defensive approach to avoid
	issues such as global scope conflicts and
	possible changes to remote JSON data.

	- Develop a 'safer' solution for setting width
	of visualization bars. Currently, if total was
	0 then text would be impossible/hard to read.
